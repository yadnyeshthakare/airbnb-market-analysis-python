# Airbnb Market Analysis (Python)

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings data using Python to understand pricing behavior, property performance, and demand patterns.

The objective is to demonstrate practical data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills on a real-world dataset.

## Project Overview

Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook  
Type: Exploratory Data Analysis  

The analysis focuses on identifying factors that influence listing prices, understanding customer preferences, and observing seasonal trends. 

## Files Included  

Airbnb_Insights_Exploration.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis  

airbnb_listings_dataset.xlsx – Dataset used in the project   

## Questions Explored

Which features influence listing prices?  

How do different room types perform?  

Are there seasonal demand patterns?  

How do reviews and availability relate to pricing?  

What general trends appear in customer preferences?  

## Workflow

Loaded and inspected the dataset  

Cleaned missing values and corrected data types  

Performed univariate and bivariate analysis  

Created visualizations for key variables  

Summarized findings into business-oriented insights  

## Tools

Data manipulation using Pandas  

Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn  

Correlation and distribution analysis  

Feature-wise grouping and aggregation  

## Key Observations

Central locations tend to have higher average prices  

Entire homes generally receive more bookings than shared rooms  

Seasonal demand patterns are visible across months  

Higher ratings are associated with higher pricing  

Budget listings cluster strongly in shared/private room categories  

## How to Run

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  

Install required libraries if needed (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  

Run the cells sequentially  

Modify the notebook to test additional hypotheses or datasets  

## Possible Extensions  

Add an interactive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI    

Include simple price prediction as a baseline model   

Add geographic visualizations using mapping libraries
